# STATUS

_Last updated: 2026-11-12_

**Phase:** Requirements engineering. Decisions D-1 … D-50 (D-5 superseded by D-23).
Fable review (`reviews/claude-fable-5-2-2026-11-12.md`) processed in rounds A–C.
**Code allowed?** No, except the **data spike** (D-31) in `spikes/`.
**Repo:** private, https://github.com/Tobechukwu-Njoku/energy-grid-simulator

## Snapshot of what's decided

Research + market-forecasting simulator (short-term and seasonal, D-25) of **GB + all-island
Ireland** with interconnectors, for consultancy/research, forecast customers (battery operators,
traders, suppliers/large users) and grants (D-33, D-41).
**Guiding principle (D-44): answer the present first.** Model today's grid accurately, validate it,
then scale out. Phases (`06-roadmap.md`): **P1** today's full transmission network with
unit commitment + Balancing Mechanism redispatch and a historic backtest → **P2** distribution,
home DER, statistical behavioural demand, AC power flow and voltages → **P3** zonal pricing and
2030 scenarios → **P4** dynamic stability and SaaS hardening.
The owner's core questions are listed in D-40.
**Rust everywhere code is needed**; TypeScript web UI in a pro-analytics, dark-mode style (D-47).
PostgreSQL 18 + Redis. Linux machine: Ryzen 5900X / 128 GB, consumer NVIDIA GPU, so the **CPU
path is primary** (R-14). Pluggable solvers. Future commercial SaaS, so **no share-alike data**.
Team (`docs/process/team.md`): Claude Opus 5.5 codes, GPT 6.1 Sol architects and reviews,
Gemini Flash does checked donkey work. Strict merge gates (D-28).

## Still open (non-blocking)

- Linux distro (Q-H-7)
- Remaining unanswered questionnaire items have defaults or are P2+ concerns

## Next steps (agents may do now)

1. Data spike (D-31): permissively licensed GB + Ireland full transmission network + one weather
   year; record licence per dataset; answers R-12.
2. Add GB + Ireland data sources to `prior-art.md` with licences (review #7); verify licence
   flags for cuDSS, SuiteSparse/KLU, TimescaleDB on PG18 (review #11).
3. Draft MVP requirements baseline in `04-requirements.md` (review #12), marking open items `ASSUMPTION:`.
4. ADRs 0001–0006 (review §4 step 8).
5. Flip to "code allowed" once 3 and ADRs 0001–0003 are accepted.
